Task 3: Simple Contact Management System
This repository contains a Python program that allows users to store and manage contact information. Users can add new contacts, view the contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts as needed. The contact details include the name, phone number, and email address. The program uses a JSON file for persistent storage of contact data.

Features:
Add a new contact by entering a name, phone number, and email address.
View all saved contacts.
Edit an existing contact's details.
Delete a contact from the list.
Persistent storage: Contacts are saved in a JSON file (contacts.json) and will be available across sessions.
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Use the menu options to:
Add new contacts.
View the contact list.
Edit or delete contacts.
Contact details are stored in a JSON file for persistence between program runs.
Example:
Add a Contact:

Input: Name: John Doe, Phone: 1234567890, Email: john@example.com
Output: Contact added successfully!
View Contacts:

Output: 1. Name: John Doe, Phone: 1234567890, Email: john@example.com
Edit a Contact:

Input: Select contact number to edit (e.g., 1), modify the name to John D., and phone to 0987654321.
Output: Contact updated successfully!
